# Boilerplate
Lightweight PHP framework for WebApps

### IMPORTANT
Boilerplate is currently early in develeopment and is therefore not suitable for use in projects. If you would like to create an app using this version of Boilerplate, compatiblity with future relases is not garuenteed. 

## Dependencies
Boilerplate only uses features builtin to PHP 7 and does not depend on any other libraries. It is designed to run on Apache Web Server, but could be modified to run on NGINX or IIS fairly easily (just create the proper rules for URL redirection, using the .htaccess file for reference).
